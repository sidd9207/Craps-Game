# Craps-Game
Program that emulates the dice game "Craps"

# How the program works
The program works just like the game craps:
You start off with a balance of 100
The program will ask you how much of your balance you want to wager
Once you've given a valid wager, the program will then ask you if you want to play
If you say yes, the program will play out the game
If you say no, the program will end
At any point, if your balance goes below 0, the program will end
